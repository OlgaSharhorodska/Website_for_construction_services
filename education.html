<h2 class="main-desc-title">10 Reasons to Use Masonry</h2>
<h3 class="main-desc">Durability</h3>
<p class="main-desc">Masonry is extremely resilient. The inherent strength and rigidity of masonry structures can
provide increased stability and resistance to natural disasters such as earthquakes,
hurricanes and tornadoes. Brick, stone and concrete block are naturally durable and
resistant to “wear and tear”. These materials do not degrade easily when exposed to wind,
rain or temperature fluctuations and therefore maintain their strength and appearance over
many years.</p>

<h3 class="main-desc">Fire Resistance</h3>
<p class="main-desc">Concrete block, stone and clay products such as brick and terra cotta are all non-
combustible. A building constructed out of masonry offers the following safety benefits
during a fire:</p>
<ul class="main-desc">
    <li>Maintain the structural integrity of load bearing walls</li>
    <li>Protect building egress</li>
    <li>Prevent fire-spread within a building and to adjacent buildings</li>
    <li>Prevent emission of toxic gasses or smoke</li>
    <li>Provide firefighter protection</li>
</ul>

<p class="main-desc">In the event the sprinkler system fails to properly operate during a fire, the built-in fire
resistive properties of masonry walls will contain the fire until it can be controlled while
allowing precious additional time for building occupants to exit.</p>

<h3 class="main-desc">Energy Savings</h3>
<p class="main-desc">Thermal mass is the ability of a material to absorb, store and release heat. Masonry
products naturally possess high thermal mass which helps moderate temperature swings
and prevents energy loss, directly lowering heating and cooling bills. A building constructed
out of concrete blocks for example will hold heat longer in cool weather and cooled air
inside for longer periods in hot weather long after the heat or air conditioning has been
turned off. This quality along with airtight walls will keep the heat energy where you want it
whether it be inside or outside of the building.</p>

<h3 class="main-desc">Structural Integrity</h3>
<p class="main-desc">Masonry construction might be best known for its strong structural integrity, which is a
result of the careful combination of materials, design principles and construction
techniques. Masonry materials have excellent compressive strength and load-bearing
capabilities making them highly suitable for constructing walls, columns, arches and other
structural elements that can support significant loads over time. The weight of a masonry
structure is distributed downward through a collective of individual masonry units and
mortar joints.</p>

<h3 class="main-desc">Aesthetic Appeal</h3>
<p class="main-desc">Masonry Construction offers a seemingly limitless amount of design possibilities. Masonry
can be adapted to various architectural styles and designs making it versatile for both
traditional and modern buildings. Different varieties of brick, stone, precast concrete and
concrete masonry units can be selected to create visually appealing textures, patterns and
colors enhancing the overall aesthetics of a structure.</p>

<h3 class="main-desc">Low Maintenance</h3>
<p class="main-desc">If a masonry building is designed by knowledgeable architects and constructed with skilled
masons the higher initial build costs will be offset by lower maintenance costs over the life
of the building. Masonry materials are resistant to severe weather, corrosion, rot, decay, UV
radiation and pests like termites and carpenter bees. When damage does occur the repairs
can often be performed on a localized basis. This can be more cost effective and less
disruptive than repairing larger sections of other modes of construction.</p>

<h3 class="main-desc">Environmentally Sustainable</h3>
<p class="main-desc">Many of the masonry materials you might choose are natural and locally available which
can reduce the environmental impact associated with transportation over long distances.
Masonry buildings can last for centuries and be repurposed for different uses with a
creative imagination and a little skillful effort. It is common to see old brick warehouses,
breweries, factories and tanneries in the historical districts of our larger cities converted
into lofts and apartments. A large assortment of masonry products are manufactured out of
recycled content and often entire brick buildings are salvaged and the bricks reused for
entirely new projects. Furthermore, masonry products typically have no volatile organic
compound (VOC) emissions. Most don’t contain integral organic-based surface coatings,
binders or sealants like many other building materials. This contributes to better indoor air
quality and a healthier environment for everyone.</p>

<h3 class="main-desc">Sound Insulation</h3>
<p class="main-desc">Masonry materials like concrete block are ideal for providing sound insulation due to their
density and mass. A masonry wall can act as a barrier by diffusing incident noise over a wide
range of frequencies and it can be an effective sound absorption material for absorbing
noise generated within a room. This is particularly useful for buildings located in areas with
significant noise pollution or where sound privacy is important.</p>

<h3 class="main-desc">Historical Significance</h3>
<p class="main-desc">Masonry construction has a long history and was used to create many iconic structures. Its
use dates back to various ancient civilizations; some include the Egyptians, Greeks and
Romans. The Pyramids of Giza, Parthenon and Colosseum are prime examples of the
monumental structures that have survived for centuries, showcasing the remarkable
craftsmanship and engineering skills of their time. Throughout the Medieval Period masonry
was essential for constructing castles, fortifications and cathedrals all across Europe. In
America’s early beginnings the use of masonry was integral to the development of colonial
settlements and historical buildings. Structures such as Colonial-Era houses, government
buildings and town squares often featured masonry components that reflected the
prevailing architectural styles of their time. In fact, masonry has shaped the urban
landscapes of cities all over the world. Cobblestone streets, brick facades and stone-paved
plazas are examples of masonry elements that contribute to the charm and character of
historic urban developments. Many monuments and memorials have been constructed
using masonry materials to commemorate historical events, wars, individuals and
achievements. Today, with many architects and designers incorporating historical masonry
elements into contemporary buildings, it is easy to see how masonry from the past
continues to influence modern architecture. Incorporating masonry into your project can
contribute to the preservation of architectural traditions and cultural heritage.</p>

<h3 class="main-desc">Increased Property Value</h3>
<p class="main-desc">Due to their durability, aesthetics, low maintenance and other benefits, properties with
masonry often have higher resale value. Masonry is often associated with a sense of
permanence and solidity. These qualities resonate with buyers seeking a stable and
comfortable lifestyle. Properties with masonry construction have a track record of holding
their value well over time. This history of appreciation can make potential buyers more
confident in their investment.</p>
